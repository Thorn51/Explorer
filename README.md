# Explorer

This app was developed as a student in the Thinkful Full Stack Flex program.

The purpose of this app is to utilize APIs to explore outdoor recreation opportunities in a user defined search area. The user will be able to search an area, choose an activity, and then be presented options for that activity in their area. Once they select an option they will be provided with useful information about the area, descriptions, and maps.
